Readme.Run ‘quadcopter_script.m’ and the simulation should work. Most functionality occurs in the 'Drone.m' file which defines the class 'Drone'. No actual simulation happens in these scripts, it is simply varying the position and orientation via trigonometric functions.Please feel free to edit/improve anything in these files. It is encouraged!
Good luck!(Author: Daniel Butters)
